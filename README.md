NAME
    Net::validMX - PERL Module to use DNS and/or regular expressions to
    verify if an email address could be valid.

SYNOPSIS
    Net::validMX - I wanted the ability to use DNS to verify if an email
    address COULD be valid by checking for valid MX records. This could be
    used for sender verification for emails with a program such as
    MIMEDefang or for websites to verify email addresses prior to
    registering users and/or sending a confirmation email.

PRE-REQUISITE MODULES
    Net::DNS v0.53 or greater. Test::More.

INSTALLATION
    To install this package, uncompress the distribution, change to the
    directory where the files are present and type:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

USE
    To use the module in your programs you will use the line:

            use Net::validMX;

  check_valid_mx
    To check if an email address could be valid by checking the DNS, call
    the function check_valid_mx with a single email address as the only
    argument:

            ($rv, $reason) = &Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

    check_valid_mx will return a true/false integer as the first value and a
    descriptive text message as warranted.

    NOTE: In the event of a DNS resolution problem, we do NOT return a
    failure. We return a success to prevent DNS outages and delays from
    producing too many false positives.

  check_email_validity
    To check if an email address is formatted correctly, call the function
    check_email_validity with a single email address as the only argument:

            $rv = &Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

    check_email_validity will return a true/false integer where > 0
    indicates that the email address looks valid.

  check_email_and_mx
    To check if an email address is formatted correctly, sanitize the email
    address some common end-user errors(*) and run check_valid_mx all from a
    single function, use the function check_email_and_mx with a single email
    address as the only argument:

            ($rv, $reason, $sanitized_email) = &Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

    check_email_and_mx will return a true/false integer where > 0 indicates
    that the email address looks valid, a descriptive text message as
    warranted, and a sanitized version of the email address argument.

    (*) Common end-user errors that are fixed:

    All spaces are stripped. Many users seem to enter things like Bob and
    Carol @ a big isp.com.
    Emails ending in @aol. or @aol are fixed to be @aol.com. Also done for
    hotmail.com, live.com & gmail.com.

  get_domain_from_email
    To extract the domain part and local part from an email address, use the
    function get_domain_from_email with a single email address as the only
    argument:

            $domain = &Net::validMX::get_domain_from_email('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

    get_domain_from_email will return a string with the domain part of the
    email address argument.

    Optionally, you can also receive the local part as well:

            ($local, $domain) = &Net::validMX::get_domain_from_email('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

    -head2 check_spf_for_domain

    To check if a domain is properly configured to send email, call the
    function check_spf_for_domain with a domain name as the only argument:

            ($rv, $reason) = &Net::validMX::check_spf_for_domain('peregrinehw.com');

    check_spf_for_domain will return "valid", "suspect", or "bad" as the
    first value and a descriptive text message as warranted.

  EXAMPLE
    The distribution contains an example program to demonstrate working
    functionality as well to utilize as a command line interface to query
    one or more email addresses.

    Run the program with the space-seperated email addresses to test as your
    arguments:

            perl example/check_email_and_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com 
    or
            perl example/check_email_and_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com google@google.com president@whitehouse.gov

    If you supply only one email address argument, the program will exit
    with a exit status of 0 for a success and 1 for a failure:

            perl example/check_email_and_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@failed || echo 'This email is no good'     

  MIMEDEFANG
    We are using this routine with MIMEDefang and have been since late 2005
    via the filter_sender hooks. For example, make a function that excludes
    authorized senders for your particular setup and add the following code
    snippets to your mimedefang-filter:

    sub filter_initialize { #for Check Valid MX use Net::validMX
    qw(check_valid_mx); }

    sub is_authorized_sender { my ($sender, $RelayAddr) = @_;

      if ([test for authorized user, private IP's, relay from 127.0.0.1, etc.]) {
        return 1;
      } else {
        return 0;
      }
    }

    sub filter_sender { my ($sender, $ip, $hostname, $helo) = @_; my ($rv,
    $reason); #md_syslog('warning', "Testing $sender, $ip, $hostname,
    $helo");

      if (&is_authorized_sender($sender, $RelayAddr)) {
        return ('CONTINUE', "ok");
      }

      if ($sender ne '<>') {
        ($rv, $reason) = &check_valid_mx($sender);
        unless ($rv) {
          md_syslog('warning', "Rejecting $sender - Invalid MX: $reason.");
          return ('REJECT', "Sorry; $sender has an invalid MX record: $reason.");
        }
      }
    }

UPDATE HISTORY
    v1.0 Released Oct 11, 2005. Original release for MIMEDefang filter.
    v2.0 Released Nov 3, 2005. Incorporated many user updates.
    v2.1 Released May 23, 2006. Switched to a perl Library (Net::validMX).
    Small efficiency change to short-circuit the DNS resolution of an IP
    address.
    v2.2 Released May 31, 2006. Clarified the LICENSE by pointing readers to
    the README. Added functions check_email_and_mx & check_email_validity.
    Expanded documentation and added check_email_and_mx &
    check_email_validity calls to example. Cleaned up distribution
    production. Changed logic to check MX records that resolve to IPs to see
    if it is privatized first.
    v2.3 & 2.4 Unreleased. Clarified the license in the Makefile.PL as
    artistic rather than perl. Continued documentation cleanup. Submitted
    for namespace registration with CPAN. Added = to chars for a username in
    the check_email_validity function. Add test case for Test for DNS where
    MX1 is private, MX2 is private but MX3 is a valid internet address for a
    pass. Began adding overloaded parameters to check_valid_mx to add
    flexibility to override default settings. Added AAAA records as valid
    for IPv6 support. Rewrote all tests to rely on test points inside a
    domain we control so that testing passes in the future.
    v2.5 Released May 8, 2020. Numerous bug fixes and moved to The McGrail
    Foundation. This product is in active use in production system.

CAVEATS
    THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

TODO
    - I'd like to have the example script automatically built to have the
    correct #!/usr/bin/perl line and possibly installed in /usr/local/bin.
    - I'd like to clean up the pod text so that the code snippets aren't
    wrapped by pod2text on the README export.
    - I'd like to add more IPv6 support including the use of private network
    addresses (fc00::/7 & fe80:).
    - Need to finish the ability to override default variables, procedural
    and OO methods and complete the documentation.

SOLVED TODO ITEMS
    - I'd like to convert the example script(s) into test script(s).
        SOLVED: Test::More was a great way to achieve this!

    - I'd like to know more info on what/how to make a META.yml file.
        SOLVED: I was using MakeMaker v6.03. Instead I upgraded to 6.30 and
        make dist or make distdir then created the META.yml file. I also
        used a trick from Net::DNS' Makefile.PL to add the license, author
        and abstract data directly to the META.yml file.

    - I'd like to make it so that the Makefile.PL creates a README on the
    fly from the pod in the library instead of pod2text lib/Net/validMX.pm >
    README.
        SOLVED: Thanks to Andreas J. Koenig for a post he wrote that dealt
        with my exact problem. I added the PREOP and DIST_DEFAULT to the
        Makefile.PL. I then modified this to use the same MANIFEST trick
        that is used for metafile and I'm happy with the end result.
