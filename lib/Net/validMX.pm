# 			 The "Artistic License"
# 
# 				Preamble
# 
# The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
# Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
# semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
# while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
# the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
# reasonable modifications.
# 
# Definitions:
# 
# 	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
# 	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
# 	created through textual modification.
# 
# 	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
# 	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
# 	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
# 
# 	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
# 	copyrights for the package.
# 
# 	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
# 	this Package.
# 
# 	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
# 	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
# 	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
# 	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
# 	as a market that must bear the fee.)
# 
# 	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
# 	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
# 	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
# 	under the same conditions they received it.
# 
# 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
# Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
# duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
# 
# 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
# derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
# modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
# 
# 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
# that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
# when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
# following:
# 
#     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
#     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
#     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
#     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
#     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
# 
#     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
# 
#     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
#     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
#     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
#     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
# 
#     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
# 
# 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
# executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
# 
#     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
#     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
#     to get the Standard Version.
# 
#     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
#     the Package with your modifications.
# 
#     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
#     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
#     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
# 
#     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
# 
# 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
# Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
# Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
# you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
# commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
# distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
# product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
# an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
# form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
# interpreter is so embedded.
# 
# 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
# output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
# under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
# them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
# Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
# Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
# binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
# neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
# fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
# not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
# Package.
# 
# 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
# languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
# emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
# Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
# equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
# not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
# regression tests for the language.
# 
# 8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
# permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
# when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
# to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
# construed as a distribution of this Package.
# 
# 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
# products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

=head1 NAME

Net::validMX - PERL Module to use DNS and/or regular expressions to verify if an email 
address could be valid.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Net::validMX - I wanted the ability to use DNS to verify if an email address
COULD be valid by checking for valid MX records.  This could be used for sender 
verification for emails with a program such as MIMEDefang or for websites to 
verify email addresses prior to registering users and/or sending a confirmation email.

=head1 PRE-REQUISITE MODULES

Net::DNS v0.53 or greater.
Test::More.

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this package, uncompress the distribution, change to the directory 
where the files are present and type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

=head1 USE

To use the module in your programs you will use the line:

	use Net::validMX;

=head2 check_valid_mx

To check if an email address could be valid by checking the DNS, call
the function check_valid_mx with a single email address as the only argument:

	($rv, $reason) = Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

check_valid_mx will return a true/false integer as the first value and a descriptive text message as warranted.

NOTE: In the event of a DNS resolution problem, we do NOT return a failure.  We return a success to prevent DNS outages and delays from producing too many false positives.


=head2 check_email_validity

To check if an email address is formatted correctly, call the function
check_email_validity with a single email address as the only argument:

	$rv = Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

check_email_validity will return a true/false integer where E<gt> 0 indicates that the email address looks valid.


=head2 check_email_and_mx

To check if an email address is formatted correctly, sanitize the email address some common end-user errors(*) and run check_valid_mx all from a single function, 
use the function check_email_and_mx with a single email address as the only argument:

        ($rv, $reason, $sanitized_email) = Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

check_email_and_mx will return a true/false integer where E<gt> 0 indicates that the email address looks valid, a descriptive text message 
as warranted, and a sanitized version of the email address argument.

(*) Common end-user errors that are fixed: 

=over 4

=item All spaces are stripped.  Many users seem to enter things like Bob and Carol @ a big isp.com.

=item Emails ending in @aol. or @aol are fixed to be @aol.com.  Also done for hotmail.com, live.com & gmail.com.  

=back

=cut

=head2 get_domain_from_email

=over 4

To extract the domain part and local part from an email address, use the function 
get_domain_from_email with a single email address as the only argument:

	$domain = Net::validMX::get_domain_from_email('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

get_domain_from_email will return a string with the domain part of the email address argument.

Optionally, you can also receive the local part as well:

        ($local, $domain) = Net::validMX::get_domain_from_email('kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com');

=back

=cut

=head2 check_spf_for_domain

=over 4

To check if a domain is properly configured to send email, call the function check_spf_for_domain with a domain name as the only argument:

	($rv, $reason) = Net::validMX::check_spf_for_domain('peregrinehw.com');

check_spf_for_domain will return "valid", "suspect", or "bad" as the first value and a descriptive text message as warranted.

=back

=cut

=head2 EXAMPLE

=over 4

The distribution contains an example program to demonstrate working functionality as well to utilize as a command line interface
to query one or more email addresses.

Run the program with the space-seperated email addresses to test as your arguments:

	perl example/check_email_and_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com 
or
	perl example/check_email_and_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@peregrinehw.com google@google.com president@whitehouse.gov

If you supply only one email address argument, the program will exit with a exit status of 0 for a success and 1 for a failure:

	perl example/check_email_and_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@failed || echo 'This email is no good'     

=back

=cut

=head2 MIMEDEFANG

We are using this routine with MIMEDefang and have been since late 2005 via the filter_sender hooks.  For example, make a function that excludes authorized senders for your particular setup and add the following code snippets to your mimedefang-filter:

sub filter_initialize {
  #for Check Valid MX
  use Net::validMX qw(check_valid_mx);
}

sub is_authorized_sender {
  my ($sender, $RelayAddr) = @_;

  if ([test for authorized user, private IP's, relay from 127.0.0.1, etc.]) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

sub filter_sender {
  my ($sender, $ip, $hostname, $helo) = @_;
  my ($rv, $reason);
  #md_syslog('warning', "Testing $sender, $ip, $hostname, $helo");

  if (is_authorized_sender($sender, $RelayAddr)) {
    return ('CONTINUE', "ok");
  }

  if ($sender ne '<>') {
    ($rv, $reason) = check_valid_mx($sender);
    unless ($rv) {
      md_syslog('warning', "Rejecting $sender - Invalid MX: $reason.");
      return ('REJECT', "Sorry; $sender has an invalid MX record: $reason.");
    }
  }
}

=head1 UPDATE HISTORY

=over 4

=item v1.0  Released Oct 11, 2005.  Original release for MIMEDefang filter.

=item v2.0  Released Nov 3, 2005.  Incorporated many user updates.

=item v2.1  Released May 23, 2006.  Switched to a perl Library (Net::validMX).  Small efficiency change to short-circuit the DNS resolution of an IP address.

=item v2.2  Released May 31, 2006.  Clarified the LICENSE by pointing readers to the README.  Added functions check_email_and_mx & check_email_validity.  Expanded documentation and added check_email_and_mx & check_email_validity calls to example.  Cleaned up distribution production.  Changed logic to check MX records that resolve to IPs to see if it is privatized first.

=item v2.3 & 2.4  Unreleased.  Clarified the license in the Makefile.PL as artistic rather than perl.  Continued documentation cleanup.  Submitted for namespace registration with CPAN.  Added = to chars for a username in the check_email_validity function.  Add test case for Test for DNS where MX1 is private, MX2 is private but MX3 is a valid internet address for a pass.  Began adding overloaded parameters to check_valid_mx to add flexibility to override default settings. Added AAAA records as valid for IPv6 support. Rewrote all tests to rely on test points inside a domain we control so that testing passes in the future.

=item v2.5  Released May 8, 2020.  Numerous bug fixes and moved to The McGrail Foundation.  This product is in active use in production system.

=item v2.5.1  In development.  Small documentation bug fixes.
